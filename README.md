## Overview
Eat-Da-Burger is a burger app which lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat. Users can submit a burger's name, they can eat the burgers they make by clicking the "Devour it" button. When the button is clicked, the burger will move to the right side. The devoured burgers' names are still displayed. User can delete them but clicking the "Delete" button. The app was created using MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM (Object Relation Mapping). Node and MySQL are used to query and route data within the app, and Express Handlebars is used to generate the HTML.
